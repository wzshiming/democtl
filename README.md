# democtl

This is a tool for recording terminal commands to svg or video.

[The old version](https://github.com/wzshiming/democtl/blob/old/democtl.sh) uses shell implementation and is no longer maintained,
It has a large number of dependencies that make it difficult to deal with compatibility,
and it uses too many languages, making it difficult to continue development, and is currently completely rewrite in Golang.
